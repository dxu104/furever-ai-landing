# Icon Assets

Icons are currently handled by Lucide React, but you can add custom icons here if needed.

## Current Icons Used:
- Social media icons (GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Mail)
- App store icons (Apple, Google Play)
- Feature icons (Heart, Users, Zap, Volume2, Activity, Brain)

## Custom Icons:
If you need custom PawLink-specific icons, add them here and update the components accordingly.
